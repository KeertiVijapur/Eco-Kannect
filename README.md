## 🧩 About the Project

The name **Eco-Kannect** is a blend of:
- **Eco** — representing the **environment**
- **Kannect** — representing **Karnataka** and a creative homophone of **"connect"**

We created Eco-Kannect to address the need for a community-first platform that promotes collaboration and awareness around sustainable practices.
